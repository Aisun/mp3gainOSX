  <dt>What is MP3Gain?</dt>
  <dd>MP3Gain is a tool to increase or decrease the volume of MP3 files without re-encoding them. This is useful when you have a lot of music at different volumes, you can use this tool to make everything the same volume so that you don't need to adjust the volume on your MP3 player when listening to your music on shuffle.</dd>
  <dt>License information</dt>
  <dd>MP3Gain is LGPL. I guess this port is LGPL then, you should adhere to the terms of that license.</dd>
